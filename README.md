## 1. Problem Statement.
- This project lies under the banking domain. A banking domain consists of all the components needed to run a financial 
  service end-to-end. It covers the transaction and distribution process; the ways in which customers interact with the 
  system, products, and services the organisation offers.
- In this project the analysis of CPI , Exchange Rate and Export Merchandise data of Deloitte Company is needed. 
  The analysis should be on a respective dashboard, which should be much user interactive so that users can manipulate the 
  graphs and perform EDA on graphs for fetching some information from it. The respective graphs must have sliders with 
  respect to countries and years for dynamic purposes. 

## 2. Project Perspective
- The main objective of this project is to show the CAGR analysis and YOY analysis in a graphical and a very interactive 
  way. So that users can fetch some information from it and can be used for further analysis and other work.
